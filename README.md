## Getting started

### Requirements

- Ruby, see `.ruby-version`, compiled with YJIT
- Node, see `.node-version`

For YJIT, Rust must first be installed and be found on `PATH`:

1. See https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for instructions on installing Rust
2. Then install the correct version of Ruby using preferred version manager:

```
asdf install ruby 3.3.0
rvm install 3.3.0
ruby-install 3.3.0
```
