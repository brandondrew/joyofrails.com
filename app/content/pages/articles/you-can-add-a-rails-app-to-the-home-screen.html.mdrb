Joy of Rails is a Progressive Web App built with Rails. You can install it as an app to your home screen of your mobile device or on your desktop from supporting browsers.

Try it. Of course, you can uninstall the app anytime.

<%= render Pwa::InstallButton %>

In this article, Iâ€™ll describe what it will take to turn your Rails app into a Progressive Web App. Let Joy of Rails serve as an example.

From "What can PWA do today?"

What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is basically just a website with some added features, which enable it to provide an app-like user-experience.

This means it can work practically just like a native iOS or Android app. It can be installed to the home screen of your mobile device, work offline and receive push notifications, among other things.

A well-designed PWA is indistinguishable from a native app, but it also offers some strong added benefits:

- It's just a website! You don't need to build separate apps anymore. If you have a website, you can easily turn it into an iOS and Android app as well!
- A PWA is much smaller than a native app. Your users no longer need to install tens of megabytes of code
- No need to get your app into the App Store or Play Store. Just share the link to your website and users can install it as an app
- There's no need to get users to install updates anymore. When you release a new version of your app, all your users automatically get the new version

By default, PWAs are served over HTTPS and are therefore safe and secure
PWAs are lightweight and offer high performance
Especially on Android, a PWA can almost do anything a native app can

As pointed out in PWA Minimal Requirements, you will need:

a 192x192 icon (PWA Manifest icon)
a 512x512 icon (PWA Manifest icon)
a 180x180 icon for iOS/MacOS (html head link: <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">)
We also suggest you to include:

A 64x64 icon for Windows (Edge) (PWA Manifest icon)
A 512x512 icon for Android with purpose: 'any' (PWA Manifest icon)
Avoid using purpose: 'any maskable' icon, as it is not supported by all browsers

<%= render Pwa::InstallButton %>
