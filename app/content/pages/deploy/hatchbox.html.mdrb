Joy of Rails deploys to a single VPS hosted by Digital Ocean managed by [Hatchbox.io](https://hatchbox.io/).

Hatchbox is a great alternative to managing your own VPS deployment via Capistrano, Mina, or Kamal. I use [a Github Action](https://github.com/joyofrails/joyofrails.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) on the `main` branch of [the Joy of Rails Github repo](https://github.com/joyofrails/joyofrails.com) for continuous deployment.

I have spend very little time debugging a failed Hatchbox deploymentâ€”they rarely happen and itâ€™s always been my fault. The Hatchbox dashboard surfaces deploy logs and Rails logs that have helped me figure out the root cause.

## Customizing Hatchbox

I do though need to customize Hatchbox from time-to-time. Iâ€˜ve put together this page as a reference mostly for myself for future reference.

Sometimes I need help understanding how Hatchbox does things under-the-hood. There is an older version of Hatchbox, now called "Hatchbox Classic" that has a pretty extensive documentation site. Joy of Rails runs on the newer version of Hatchbox which doesnâ€™t appear to have a docs site (as far as I know).

To make up the gap, they have [a help desk site](https://hatchbox.relationkit.io/collections) and have been very responsive to my questions or Iâ€˜ve otherwise been able to find what I need there.

Here is a collection of helpful articles from the new Hatchbox help site:

- To add symlinks during a deploy, you would use https://hatchbox.relationkit.io/articles/73-deploy-script-variables
- How to enable jemalloc: https://hatchbox.relationkit.io/articles/122-how-can-i-use-jemalloc-with-my-application

Iâ€™ve also opened up some tickets. I _think_ itâ€˜s difficult to share long-lived links to these conversations since they live behind a login or temporary token. Here are some selected screenshots to conversations Iâ€˜ve had I may need to refer back to.

![Conversation about Bundler Config](content/hatchbox/conversation-bundler-config.jpg 'Conversation about Bundler Config')

![Conversation about systemd part 2](content/hatchbox/conversation-systemd-2.jpg 'Conversation about systemd part 2')

Iâ€˜d recommend giving Hatchbox a try if you like the idea of using VPS like DigitalOcean and donâ€™t want to spend time wrestling with Kamal.
